## Interconsole Java


Hi there ! Wanna to create an interactive console application in Java? 

Interconsole 's not a bad choice to start, it's make initializing your app become much faster! 

You can save anything with key to "Temp" Object, it will remain till you delete or terminate your console



### How to use
To add a new method, go to prototype/method and create one implemented "Method" interface.

And if you want your method can be invoked in console, just go to **prototype.method.Library.java** and add yours.
